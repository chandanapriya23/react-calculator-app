## App Overview
Created a web app using any React (Javascript) language which logs calculations as it happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the app. This app implements only basic arithmetic operations.

```
For example, 
user A and user B go to the app at the same time. User A calculates “5 + 5”, which equals “10".
This is logged below the calculator as “5 + 5 = 10”. User B is updated about this calculation right after user A posts it. 
Now, user B calculates “3 x 4".This calculates to “12” and displays “3 x 4=12" right below the prior calculation. 
User A sees this update immediately after user B posts it.

Results will remain between sessions. Only show the last 10 calculations descending from most recent to oldest. 

The app is hosted and deployed to be publicly.
